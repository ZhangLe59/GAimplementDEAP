# Mechine Learning - Evolution - Genetic Algorithm Implement
This project is implement for Genetic Algorithm with DEAP lib

# Getting Started
python library required: deap

Prerequisites
pip3 install deap

# examples for GAdeapimpl
1. run : 
  python3 GAdeapimpl.py
2. input the number : 
  pls input the list, saperate with , :1,3,2,5,4,9,7,3,4,8,7,4  //this is the example
3. input the number of the result solution printed: 
  pls input the number of result:1
4. get output : 
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 0, 0]]
  
The example is for the case: to get the max income dealing the stock under different price.
1 refer to buy action, -1 refer to sell action. 0 refer to non action.
Therefore the result is : 
  - buy at price 1, buy at price 3, buy at price 2, buy at price 5, buy at price 4,
  - sell at price 9,
  - buyt at price 7, buyt at price 3, buy at price 4, 
  - sell at price 8.
  - income is the max.
