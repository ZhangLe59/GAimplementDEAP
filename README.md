implement Genetic Algorithm using DEAP lib

# user guide for GAdeapimpl
1# run : 
  python3 GAdeapimpl,py
2# input the number : 
  pls input the list, saperate with , :1,3,2,5,4,9,7,3,4,8,7,4  //this is the example
3# input the number of the result solution printed: 
  pls input the number of result:1
3# get output : 
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 0, 0]]
  
 The example is for the case: to get the max income dealing the stock under different price.
 1 refer to buy action, -1 refer to sell action. 0 refer to non action.
 Therefore the result is : 
  buy at price 1, buy at price 3, buy at price 2, buy at price 5, buy at price 4,
  sell at price 9,
  buyt at price 7, buyt at price 3, buy at price 4,
